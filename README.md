# NORBIT Proximitiy Based RTLS Backend

## Installation guide
To install and run the backend, follow the steps below.
It is important to note that an env.py file, containing authentication
information, is required for accessing both NORBITâ€™s and our database.
Without this file the back-end server will not work.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or newer

### Installation steps
After navigating to the desired folder in your terminal, run the following
commands to start the project:  

    git clone https://github.com/haakon8855/NORBIT-backend.git
    cd NORBIT-backend
    python3 -m pip install pipenv
    python3 -m pipenv install

Lastly, to start the backend server, run  

    python3 main.py

Remember to have the env.py file ready. A tunnel is also required to access the database.
